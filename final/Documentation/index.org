  This file is dedicated to explain all the  covered points according to web app short course criterias.
  The principle that is followed while building this application is modularity.
  It is thought that the biggest gain from modularity is safety and ease of
  evolution in incorporating newer requirements.

  The Goal of this documentation is to walk you through an end-to-end requirements
  specification, design, development and deployment of the  web application buit in our project.
