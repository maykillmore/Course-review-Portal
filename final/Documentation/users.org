* Users

** User Identification
   Each user has an email address (string that corresponds to a
   valid email addr). 
** Uniqueness of a User
   No two users can have same E-mail Address.Trying to register with already
   registered e-mail address throws an error.
** Role of a User
   Each user has one or more role, and by default when a user is created, the
   role that is associated with the newly created user is =user=

   have the same role. i.e. each session of a user is mapped to a different role.
